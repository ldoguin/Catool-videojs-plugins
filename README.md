# README

This repository is for VideoJS plugins developed specifically for the Catool project. 

### Plugins

* Rangeslider - this is a simple double-thumb slider that can displayed above the seek bar. The purpose of the plugin is to make it easier to set IN/OUT points when annotating a video.

_Note_: Since VideoJS did not support a plugin framework at the time of this writing, it was necessary to fork VideoJS and implement basic plugin functionality.
